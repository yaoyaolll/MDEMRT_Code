'C:\Users\WYJ-PC\Desktop\MultiEMRT_MAIN_FPGA_20190121_1\designer'
Info: The design MAIN_TOP.adb was last modified by software version 11.8.3.6.
Opened an existing Libero design MAIN_TOP.adb.

The Execute Script command succeeded ( 00:00:22 )
While analyzing gated clock network, ambiguities have been found on gates
address_encoder_0/state_RNISNSU1[0]:Y.
The timing models of these gates have been simplified for Static Timing Analysis.
Info: Combinational loops have been detected in the design.
